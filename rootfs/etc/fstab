# The syntax of busybox's fstab entry's a little different than traditional
# mount, and doesn't work with the usual 'rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0' entry.
# Actually, it's not needed unless you're mounting from a non-nfs device,
# like a hard disk.  In that case, you probably need something like the 
# following:

proc            /proc           proc    defaults                0      0
sysfs           /sys            sysfs   defaults                0      0
devpts          /dev/pts        devpts  gid=5,mode=620          0      0
tmpfs           /dev/shm        tmpfs   rw                      0      0
/mnt            /mnt            tmpfs   rw,mode=755,size=1M     0      0
/var            /var            tmpfs   rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev  0      0

# usbfs isn't mounted by default as either USB needs to be statically linked
# into the kernel, or the usbcore kernel module needs to be loaded
# none          /proc/bus/usb   usbfs   defaults                0      0

# tmpfs isn't mounted on /tmp by default for two reasons:
#  a) it increases the memory footprint
#  b) files there will disappear on reboot
